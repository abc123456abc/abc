Hello All,

Finally the moment has arrived to say goodbye, which is never easy. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with each of you with whom I have interacted.

Sincere thanks to all my senior team members ,under whom I have worked, and my colleagues for their support and guidance to excel in my career. And a very Big "Thank You" to all my team members and friends with whom I have spent the wonderful moments, that would last a lifetime.

Even though I will miss you all, I am looking forward to this new challenge and to start a new phase in my career. I wish you all the very best in life. I am reachable at my personal email "arun.tripathi1979@gmail.com" and 9930243180.

It was a pleasure knowing each and every one of you. Needless to say, please stay in touch.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Arun Prakash Tripathi
